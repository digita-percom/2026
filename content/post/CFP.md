# Call for Papers
The **Digital Twin Ecosystems & Applications (DIGITA)** workshop aims to provide a platform for sharing
knowledge and experiences in the field of Digital Twin Ecosystems and their practical applications. This workshop
seeks to explore the latest trends, challenges, and opportunities in the engineering and application of pervasive systems adopting the Digital Twin
Ecosystems approach.
Methodologies and tools for design and development, enabling technologies, and innovative use cases
will be presented and discussed.
Additionally, the workshop will offer an opportunity for researchers, practitioners,
and industry experts to exchange ideas, collaborate on projects, and foster advancements in the rapidly evolving
field of DT.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

* Digital Twin modelling 
* Engineering Pervasive Computing applications with Digital Twins
* Simulation techniques for Digital Twins
* Artificial Intelligence and Digital Twins
* Integration of IoT, AI, Big Data Analytics and Simulation in Digital Twin Ecosystems
* Digital Twins and DT Ecosystems Software Engineering methods and frameworks
* Applications of Digital Twins in Smart Industry, Healthcare Systems, Energy Management, and Smart Cities
* Case studies and real-world implementations
* Security, privacy, and ethical considerations in Digital Twin Ecosystems
* Standards, interoperability, and scalability of Digital Twin Ecosystems
* Coordination and Communication in Digital Twins Ecosystems
* Communication protocols in Digital Twins Ecosystems



# Submission instructions

Authors are invited to submit full papers that are unpublished and not under review elsewhere. 
All submissions will undergo a peer-review process by Program Commitee members in a single blind fashion.
