Keynote: Requirements and Design Architecture for Digital Twin End-to-End Trustworthiness Speaker: Antonio Virdis Keynote Speaker: Antonio Virdis.
Abstract The wide adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) involves a previously unseen level of complexity imposing to multiple stakeholders to deal with and trust the complex integration of applications with a plethora of heterogeneous devices. In this context, digital twins (DTs) have emerged as a suitable paradigm for bridging the digital and physical domains by masking the complexity of the latter with established software interfaces made available to applications by the former.</description>
